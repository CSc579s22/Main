Steps:

+ Clients join the network by "connecting the port to OVS switch"
(manually configured on OVS switch)
+ Ryu controller monitors events from OVS switches, after it received
port_add event from switch, modify topology, save to database
+ Clients start AStream player, send a request to server, receives the
nearest cache server(by hops) and mpd file url
+ Clients start playing using the mpd file url received above
+ Ryu controller monitors ports' speed, and make predictions of ports'
bandwidth(average), save to database
+ Clients periodically requests estimated port bandwidth to benefit
local bandwidth estimation
+ Analysis logs generated by AStream player(quality switches, vmaf,
bandwidth, latency, cache hit/miss)


TODO:

- [ ] use ARIMA(or simpler estimation) to replace bandwidth estimation
- [x] dynamically dispatch servers based on SABR bandwidth
- [ ] dispatch near cache servers by latency
- [ ] set link speed and latency to simulate network congestion
- [ ] calculate fairness on Ryu controller
- [ ] set port link speed/QoS based on fairness
- [ ] AStream is not compatible with current MPD file
- [ ] Varnish cache: cache-hit/cache-miss
