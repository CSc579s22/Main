# QoE Improvements For Adaptive Video Streaming Over SDN-Enabled Networks

## Install

### Provision on CloudLab

1. Create a CloudLab profile using [`multilayer.py`](./server/topology/multilayer.py)
2. Instantiate an experiment using the profile created above
3. After the experiment is ready, copy the `Manifest` from CloudLab experiment details page into [`topo.xml`](./topo.xml)
4. Run [`validate_topo.py`](./validate_topo.py) to validate topology
5. Update server login information (username, hostname, port) in [`config.py`](./config.py)
6. Run [`get_testbed_info.py`](./get_testbed_info.py), update `Switch` and `Node` in [`server/config.py`](./server/config.py) using the information printed in the last step
7. Run [`setup_testbed.py`](./setup_testbed.py) to install dependencies on nodes

## Design

Steps:

+ Clients join the network by "connecting the port to OVS switch"
(manually configured on OVS switch)
+ Ryu controller monitors events from OVS switches, after it received
port_add event from switch, modify topology, save to database
+ Clients start AStream player, send a request to server, receives the
nearest cache server(by hops) and mpd file url
+ Clients start playing using the mpd file url received above
+ Ryu controller monitors ports' speed, and make predictions of ports'
bandwidth(average), save to database
+ Clients periodically requests estimated port bandwidth to benefit
local bandwidth estimation
+ Analysis logs generated by AStream player(quality switches, vmaf,
bandwidth, latency, cache hit/miss)


TODO:

- [ ] use ARIMA(or simpler estimation) to replace bandwidth estimation
- [x] dynamically dispatch servers based on SABR bandwidth
- [ ] dispatch near cache servers by latency
- [ ] set link speed and latency to simulate network congestion
- [ ] calculate fairness on Ryu controller
- [ ] set port link speed/QoS based on fairness
- [ ] AStream is not compatible with current MPD file
- [ ] Varnish cache: cache-hit/cache-miss
