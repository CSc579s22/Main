Steps:
1. Clients join the network by "connecting the port to OVS switch"
(manually configured on OVS switch)
2. Ryu controller monitors events from OVS switches, after it received
port_add event from switch, modify topology, save to database
3. Clients start AStream player, send a request to server, receives the
nearest cache server(by hops) and mpd file url
4. Clients start playing using the mpd file url received above
5. Ryu controller monitors ports' speed, and make predictions of ports'
bandwidth(average), save to database
6. Clients periodically requests estimated port bandwidth to benefit
local bandwidth estimation
7. Analysis logs generated by AStream player(quality switches, vmaf,
bandwidth, latency, cache hit/miss)


TODO:
1. dispatch near cache servers by latency
2. use ARIMA to replace bandwidth estimation
3. set link speed and latency to simulate network congestion
4. calculate fairness on Ryu controller
5. set port link speed/QoS based on fairness
